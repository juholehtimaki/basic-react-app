      Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Every
      day I learn. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around
      and having fun. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no
      fear.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over
      is the garbage. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Everyone
      needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Only
      eight colors that you need.
    </p>

    <p>
      Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Just take out whatever you
      don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Van Dyke Brown is a very
      nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. We artists are a different
      breed of people. We're a happy bunch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working it up and down, back and forth. Everything's not great in life,
      but we can still find beauty in it. The light is your friend. Preserve it.
      This is truly an almighty mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy
      then it's good. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what
      it is. Learn when to stop. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done
      it this time.' And you may be right. Clouds are free. They just float
      around the sky all day and have fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can spend all day playing with mountains. If you don't think every day
      is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. You're the greatest thing
      that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very
      special. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Mix your color marbly
      don't mix it dead. Just use the old one inch brush.
    </p>

    <p>
      Poor old tree. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy
      things in here. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Maybe he has a
      little friend that lives right over here. We'll paint one happy little
      tree right here. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can do it. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance
      around and have fun. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks
      for the easiest way to do things Let's make some happy little clouds in
      our world. And just raise cain.
    </p>

    <p>
      This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing
      it. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a
      mountain. Those great big fluffy clouds.
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Look around, look at
      what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Use
      what you see, don't plan it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. We don't
      really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's get
      crazy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. We
      don't have to be committed. We are just playing here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. It's amazing what you can
      do with a little love in your heart. We can always carry this a step
      further. There's really no end to this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these
      happy things? Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.
      I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a
      little touch of yellow. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to
      Washington. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. It all happens
      automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the
      framework first. Don't fight it, use what happens. Just go out and talk to
      a tree. Make friends with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to
      freeze me to death. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Fluff
      it up a little and hypnotize it. Pretend you're water. Just floating
      without any effort. Having a good day. All kinds of happy little splashes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Be so very light. Be a
      gentle whisper. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zip. That easy. In your world you have total and absolute power. That
      easy. We don't have anything but happy trees here. We want to use a lot
      pressure while using no pressure at all. We must be quiet, soft and
      gentle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Put it in, leave it alone. How do you make a round circle with a square
      knife? That's your challenge for the day. Don't kill all your dark areas -
      you need them to show the light.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Don't forget to tell
      these special people in your life just how special they are to you. The
      least little bit can do so much. Use what happens naturally, don't fight
      it. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You
      can do anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush
      like that. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. We spend so
      much of our life looking - but never seeing. Let your imagination be your
      guide. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your
      heart.
