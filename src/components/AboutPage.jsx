    <h1>About page</h1>
    <p>
      You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. You can do anything
      your heart can imagine. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than
      you do from your masterpieces. Son of a gun. I sincerely wish for you
      every possible joy life could bring. You have to make those little noises
      or it won't work.
    </p>

    <p>
      In your world you can create anything you desire. We'll do another happy
      little painting. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.
      You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. We'll throw
      some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. We don't
      have anything but happy trees here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let your imagination be your guide. I'm going to mix up a little color.
      We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian
      Blue. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a
      little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's make a happy little mountain now. You can create anything that makes
      you happy. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Every highlight needs
      it's own personal shadow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use your imagination, let it go. Let's go up in here, and start having
      some fun Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. You don't
      have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let
      it happen. We can fix anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these
      happy things? We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Those
      great big fluffy clouds. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll
      change your entire perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use what you see, don't plan it. These little son of a guns hide in your
      brush and you just have to push them out. Everybody's different. Trees are
      different. Let them all be individuals. So often we avoid running water,
      and running water is a lot of fun. I really recommend you use odorless
      thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll
      be working by yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and
      having a snow-covered dinner. A happy cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll
      send him to Washington.
    </p>

    <p>
      We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Have fun with it.
      Just use the old one inch brush. Let's have a little bit of fun today.
    </p>

    <p>
      See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Let's do
      that again. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with
      snow.
    </p>

    <p>
      And maybe a little bush lives there. Every single thing in the world has
      its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little
      rascals. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.
    </p>

    <p>
      In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move
      mountains. In this world, everything can be happy. We spend so much of our
      life looking - but never seeing. I was blessed with a very steady hand;
      and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things.
    </p>

    <p>
      See there how easy that is. Get away from those little Christmas tree
      things we used to make in school. Pretend you're water. Just floating
      without any effort. Having a good day. You can create beautiful things -
      but you have to see them in your mind first. That's the way I look when I
      get home late; black and blue. It's all a game of angles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only eight colors that you need. You don't want to kill all your dark
      areas they are very important. Everyone is going to see things differently
      - and that's the way it should be. How to paint. That's easy. What to
      paint. That's much harder. We'll put a happy little bush here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's do it again then, what the heck. You are only limited by your
      imagination. At home you have unlimited time. For the lack of a better
      word I call them hangy downs. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.
    </p>

    <p>
      It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it.
      Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. If
      these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your
      painting and get your floor wet. Just let go - and fall like a little
      waterfall. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in
      minutes? Don't be bashful drop me a line.
    </p>

    <p>
      You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're
      special. You're so very special. We must be quiet, soft and gentle.
      Anything you want to do you can do here. That is when you can experience
      true joy, when you have no fear. Let all these things just sort of happen.
      I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just a little indication. Be brave. Be careful. You can always add more -
      but you can't take it away. I started painting as a hobby when I was
      little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued
      interest. Anybody can do what I do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Let
      that brush dance around there and play. Painting should do one thing. It
      should put happiness in your heart. We can always carry this a step
      further. There's really no end to this.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.
      Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. By now you should be
      quite happy about what's happening here. Let your imagination be your
      guide. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. That easy.
    </p>

    <p>
      We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Working it
      up and down, back and forth. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a
      little friend. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come
      into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't
      take much to get you addicted. We don't really know where this goes - and
      I'm not sure we really care. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't
      have big clouds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.
      Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. We
      have all at one time or another mixed some mud.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I
      can make this world as happy as I want it. It looks so good, I might as
      well not stop. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the
      little creatures in nature. You want your tree to have some character.
      Make it special. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zip. That easy. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? The
      light is your friend. Preserve it. We have no limits to our world. We're
      only limited by our imagination. All those little son of a guns.
    </p>

    <p>
      The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Don't
      be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just
      make themselves. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.
      This is gonna be a happy little seascape.
    </p>

    <p>
      Play with the angles. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here
      and play. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to
      use them. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have
      power over is the garbage. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be
      there. What the devil.
    </p>

    <p>
      I like to beat the brush. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting
      colder. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it.
      Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything.
      As long as you believe. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over
      here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.
      Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. If it's not what
      you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will
      get better. There are no limits in this world. It's a good way of getting
      rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Anyone can paint.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke
      Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. All you
      have to do is let your imagination go wild. Let's make a nice big leafy
      tree. Don't fiddle with it all day. Anytime you learn something your time
      and energy are not wasted.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express
      yourself to others through painting. You've got to learn to fight the
      temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Let's put some
      happy trees and bushes back in here. With practice comes confidence. If
      we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Fluff it up a
      little and hypnotize it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a lot of fun. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life
      just how special they are to you. I really believe that if you practice
      enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.
    </p>

    <p>
      A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We don't need
      any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out
      of us. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have
      that power. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things.
      But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics.
    </p>

    <p>
      There we are. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them
      out. Let your heart be your guide. Here we're limited by the time we have.
      Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Tree trunks grow however
      makes them happy.
    </p>

    <p>
      There we go. Just make a decision and let it go. No worries. No cares.
      Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's put a touch more of the magic here. This is your world. You could
      sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you
      could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. It's life. It's
      interesting. It's fun. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around
      in the sky all day long. Trees cover up a multitude of sins.
    </p>

    <p>
      All kinds of happy little splashes. Don't kill all your dark areas - you
      need them to show the light. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in
      the sky being lazy. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever
      happened in my life.
    </p>

    <p>
      You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. We
      don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. I thought today we
      would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods
      here. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Talent is a pursued
      interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Be so very
      light. Be a gentle whisper.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees,
      and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Mountains are so simple,
      they're hard. This is truly an almighty mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Work that paint.
      We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. You need to
      have a very firm paint to do this. Put light against light - you have
      nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of
      light and dark that each give the other one meaning. How do you make a
      round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have a fantastic little sky! Learn when to stop. Just relax and let it
      flow. That easy. And right there you got an almighty cloud.
