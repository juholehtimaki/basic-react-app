      Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Let all
      these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Follow
      the lay of the land. It's most important. I'm gonna start with a little
      Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Exercising the imagination,
      experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly
      the windows to your soul. It's so important to do something every day that
      will make you happy. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness
      in your heart. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we
      really care.
    </p>

    <p>
      The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite
      direction. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.
      That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you
      paint. Look at them little rascals. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of
      equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. There comes a nice little
      fluffer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's get crazy. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball
      in the sky. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know
      I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can
      do what I do. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life -
      to be able to share this with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've
      known sorrow. You are only limited by your imagination. All those little
      son of a guns. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's something that's fun. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives
      right in here. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of
      our minds. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. So
      often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run
      you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Let your
      imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Everything
      is happy if you choose to make it that way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't be bashful drop me a line. The first step to doing anything is to
      believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start.
      This is gonna be a happy little seascape.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Working it
      up and down, back and forth. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Now it's
      beginning to make a little sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Trees cover up a multitude of sins.
      A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Use absolutely no pressure. Just
      like an angel's wing.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about
      them and take care of them. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll
      take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. This piece of canvas is your world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? We'll throw some old
      gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Remember how free
      clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Let's get wild
      today. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Pretend
      you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Let
      your heart take you to wherever you want to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the
      heck. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have
      that power. There are no limits in this world. Just take out whatever you
      don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Let's have
      a little bit of fun today. Everyone is going to see things differently -
      and that's the way it should be. All kinds of happy little splashes. You
      can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and
      make something beautiful out of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. We have no limits to
      our world. We're only limited by our imagination. In your world you can
      create anything you desire. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get
      my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. I thought today we would make a
      happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. In your
      world you have total and absolute power.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown,
      some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. We need dark in order to
      show light. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God
      bless, my friends. The more we do this - the more it will do good things
      to our heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      There we go. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.
      See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's
      have a happy little tree in here. With practice comes confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.
      There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Have fun with
      it. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Use what happens
      naturally, don't fight it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's put a touch more of the magic here. You can do anything here. So
      don't worry about it. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.
      Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. It's important
      to me that you're happy.
    </p>

    <p>
      I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's
      okay though; I have more fun than most people. Just a little indication.
      Here's another little happy bush
    </p>

    <p>
      Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.
      Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. These trees are so
      much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. You want
      your tree to have some character. Make it special. A happy cloud. We start
      with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fluff that up. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's
      nothing worse than a cloud killer. Once you learn the technique, ohhh!
      Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger.
    </p>

    <p>
      We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Paint anything
      you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Even trees need a friend.
      We all need friends. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and
      special as you are. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. This
      is your world.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. All you
      have to do is let your imagination go wild. A fan brush can be your best
      friend.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let's make a happy little mountain
      now. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. It's almost like something out
      of a fairytale book. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and
      create all these happy things?
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. We artists are a
      different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And that's when it becomes
      fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening -
      you just let it happen. That's a son of a gun of a cloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees,
      and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. You can do anything your
      heart can imagine. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.
      If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Just let these leaves
      jump off the brush
    </p>

    <p>
      Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in
      school. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. I can't think of
      anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others
      through painting. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain
      what it is. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. Just use the old one inch brush.
      It takes dark in order to show light. There is no right or wrong - as long
      as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Just make little strokes
      like that. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can spend all day playing with mountains. That's crazy. A little happy
      sunlight shining through there. In your imagination you can go anywhere
      you want.
    </p>

    <p>
      We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get
      everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you
      addicted. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.
      The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. If there's two big
      trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. It's
      amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Now, we're going to fluff
      this cloud. We don't have anything but happy trees here. This present
      moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just
      let them happen. And just raise cain. There's nothing wrong with having a
      tree as a friend. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in
      very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Talk to trees,
      look at the birds. Whatever it takes. We have a fantastic little sky!
    </p>

    <p>
      The light is your friend. Preserve it. You can create anything that makes
      you happy. Let your imagination be your guide. It's a super day, so why
      not make a beautiful sky? Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is
      everywhere, you only have to look to see it.
    </p>

    <p>
      You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Let's put some
      happy little clouds in our world. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to
      Washington. That easy. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does
      help. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue.
    </p>

    <p>
      But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This painting comes
      right out of your heart. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they
      are very important. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to
      it yet. Poor old tree. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Very easy to work these to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Give
      him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trees grow however makes them happy. I will take some magic white, and a
      little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. No pressure.
      Just relax and watch it happen. Almost everything is going to happen for
      you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.
      Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Let's do it again
      then, what the heck. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side
      now.
